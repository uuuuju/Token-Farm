# Token-Farm
A liquidity pool consisting of two tokens

This is blockchain based exchange system that works similar to a bank. This project is intended to be used as a decentralized finance platform in which an investor can stake some already existing DAI tokens on the platform for a given period of time to get incentivized with fictitious DAPP tokens. It is a liquidity mining pool consisting of two tokens: the DAI token and the DAPP token.
An investor or the person that uses this token farm as a digital bank is a person who holds some DAI tokens and stakes them in the token farm. Whenever they stake it on some sort of regular interval, they earn DAPP Tokens for doing that. The invested tokens could then be used for lending and borrowing as is usually done in a banking system. Investors can then withdraw the DAPP Tokens as well as the DAI tokens that they staked. This indicates the necessity of a smart contract that takes DAI deposits and issues DAPP tokens (TokenFarm smart contract).
