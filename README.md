# Token-Farm
A liquidity pool consisting of two tokens

This is blockchain based exchange system that works similar to a bank. This project is intended to be used as a decentralized finance platform in which an investor can stake some already existing DAI tokens on the platform for a given period of time to get incentivized with fictitious DAPP tokens. It is a liquidity mining pool consisting of two tokens: the DAI token and the DAPP token.
An investor or the person that uses this token farm as a digital bank is a person who holds some DAI tokens and stakes them in the token farm. Whenever they stake it on some sort of regular interval, they earn DAPP Tokens for doing that. The invested tokens could then be used for lending and borrowing as is usually done in a banking system. Investors can then withdraw the DAPP Tokens as well as the DAI tokens that they staked. This indicates the necessity of a smart contract that takes DAI deposits and issues DAPP tokens (TokenFarm smart contract).

Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset or security can be sold for cash without affecting its price. It is the degree by which an asset can be quickly purchased or sold at a market price reflecting its current value. A liquidity pool is a reserve of certain kinds of tokens secured in a smart contract to ease the trading of decentralized exchanges.Financial Exchange can broadly be categorized into Order book trading and Liquidity Pool Exchange, the former being the most commonly used trading mechanism. In order book trading, buyers and sellers place an order at their chosen price for a token, with buyers placing buy orders and sellers placing
sell orders. While buyers try to buy an asset at the lowest price possible, sellers try to sell it for as high as possible. In order for the trade to occur, both the buyer and the seller have to agree on the price. A matching engine then matches an opposite order for the price offered. This kind of system works well only when there are a sufficient number of buyers and sellers in the market that is when there is enough liquidity. Tokens with low liquidity risk being swayed by large individual transactions and the external market. This is solved by the concept of Automated Market Makers or AMMs and Liquidity pools. AMMs use smart contracts instead of Order books to form liquidity pools that automatically execute trades based on the specified parameters, thus eliminating the token’s dependence on trade volume and ensuring constant liquidity at different price levels.
When you provide liquidity into a pool, you typically receive an LP token in exchange.

A basic liquidity pool contains two tokens and uses a DEX to create a market for that pair of tokens. DAI/ETH is an example of a popular duo. The first liquidity provider (LP) establishes the initial price of the assets in the freshly formed pool and adds an equal amount to both tokens. You may start with $10 DAI and $10 ETH, for example. As a result, traders can now trade against the liquidity pool's liquidity. There does not need to be a seller at that time for the buyer to buy; all that is required is adequate liquidity in the pool. This also means that the liquidity pool allows traders to trade against those funds at any time of day or night. This LP token represents your share in the liquidity pool. Every time when a trade is made on the liquidity pool, users have to pay a fee. These fees are then aggregated and re-distributed back to all liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis based on the amount of LP tokens you hold. All additional liquidity providers who want to offer liquidity to the pool must adhere to the same principle of an equal supply of both assets. AMMs have made market-making substantially more accessible because anyone may be a liquidity provider — as long as they have the appropriate asset(s) for the platform of choice. Liquidity providers receive LP tokens in exchange for giving their funds, which are proportional to their share of the total liquidity. A transaction charge is proportionally dispersed among all Liquidity Providers whenever a trade is facilitated. If a liquidity provider wants their underlying liquidity as well as any fees owed to them, they must burn the LP tokens they own. The price of assets is determined by the Liquidity Pool's token ratio. When you buy DAI from the DAI/ETH pool, for example, the quantity of DAI is reduced while the supply of ETH is proportionally raised. This will result in a price increase for DAI and a price decrease for ETH. It's worth noting that larger pools have the advantage of enabling larger trades without causing the asset's price to move too much. They reduce slippage, resulting in a more pleasant trading experience.
